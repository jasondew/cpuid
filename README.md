# CPUID instruction example

This is an adaptation of the sample code from the [Wikipedia article on the
CPUID instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPUID) made to work on MacOS.
The easiest way to try it out is by running:

```sh
gcc -o cpuid cpuid.s
./cpuid
```

On Ubuntu/Linux:

```sh
gcc -o cpuid cpuid.ubuntu.s
./cpuid
```
